            <img src="images/mission.png" width="10%">
            <h2>Our Mission</h2>
            <p>A four-day case competition drawing together students from universities around the world, SLASummit sets out to not only highlight major issues facing Latin American communities but cultivate ideas proposing tangible solutions to these problems. By bringing together academic experts in related fields and social entrepreneurs with real-world experience, to give both TED-style talks and interactive workshops, the conference emerges as a unique platform to develop innovative and creative projects that will be sustainably implemented and maintained for years to come. Differentiating itself as more than just a case competition to apply critical thinking and presentation skills, the purpose of SLASummit is to the develop winning ideas into solutions that will visibly improve the lives of Latin American communities in need.</p>

            <img src="images/story.png" width="10%">
            <h2>Our Story</h2>
            <h3>Our Roots</h3>
            <p>SLASummit emerged as a TED-style conference focused on raising awareness about current Latin American issues and establishing networks between McGill and the Montreal Latin American community. Transitioning from a descriptive dialogue to a prescriptive one, SLASummit began looking for ways of making a greater impact.  </p>
            <h3>Our inspiration</h3>
            <p>Concurrently, SLASA, the Spanish and Latin American Students' Association of McGill University, embarked on a social project in Mexico to help a community of  primary school children get to school faster. With a budget of $5,000, we not only provided bicycles for 30 children, reducing their transport time by more than half, but we also implemented a bike rental business with its own repair garage to ensure sustainability. </p> 
            <br><p>With this past example of bottom-up, community based success, SLASA decided to revamp the conference as a networking and launch platform for development projects. By bringing together passionate students and leading professionals, SLASummit develops targeted solutions, promoting cooperation and dialogue, to specific Latin American issues. 
            <p>
            <br>

            <img src="images/approach.png" width="10%">
            <h2>Our Approach</h2>
            <h3>Sustainable Development</h3>
            <p>SLASummit holds a firm belief in bottom-up, self-empowering forms of development. The proposed solutions will not only be the answers to problems communicated directly by the community, but also selected and implemented in conjunction with the local population.  By taking this participatory approach, we not only ensure long-term sustainability but also improve the efficiency of implemented projects, catering to communities’ needs as specifically as possible. Moreover, we reach more complete answers by strengthening the development of ideas as they must be deemed viable from the different perspectives of students and experts from a diverse group of participants.</p>

            <p> SLASummit convenes a pool of selected participants to face this challenge of permanently changing the lives of more than 30 people with less than $5,000. 150 selected students from universities across the world get randomly grouped into 25 teams and assigned one of the three communities to compete for the funds that the winning team will receive to implement their initiative. 


            This revamped concept emerges as a networking and launch platform for sustainable development projects. By bringing together passionate students and leading professionals, SLASummit 2015 will develop targeted solutions, promoting cooperation and dialogue, to specific Latin American issues.
